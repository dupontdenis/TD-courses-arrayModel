# TD-courses-arrayModel

This project is a Node.js/Express application for managing courses. It is designed as a student exercise to help you learn about REST APIs, controllers, models, and views.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd TD-courses-arrayModel
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

Start the server with:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Project Structure

- `app_server/` - Contains server-side controllers, routes, and views.
- `app_api/` - Intended for API controllers, models, and routes (see TODO below).
- `public/` - Static files (JS, CSS, fonts).

## TODO (for students)

Complete the `app_api` directory:

- Implement API controllers in `app_api/controllers/courses.js`.
- Create models in `app_api/models/courses.js`.
- Set up API routes in `app_api/routes/index.js`.

Refer to the structure and logic in `app_server` for guidance.
